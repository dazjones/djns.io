During my latest guitar building adventures, I've started to experiment with different woods for the guitar bodies.

A couple of builds have now been completed, one with a poplar body and another with beech. I have cut a few body blanks from Alder to experiment with next!

Here is before and after the cavity routing:

A rough sand ready for painting:

Making sure the neck fits!

And like magic, they're finally complete!

The poplar is really light, but the guitar has a surprising amount of sustain.

The beech is really heavy, no surprise that is sustains for days but I acutally quite like the weight!
